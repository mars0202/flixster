### Notes
The biggest hurdle I encountered was a fatal error and I did not know how to debug it at first because it was taking me to a file with the class AppDelegate which I was unfamiliar with. Intimidated by the output of the error I did not notice that it was speaking about some parts of the storyboard that were not setup correctly. After realizing this, I was able to swifty fix the issues and get my program compiling and running again.
